## [Unreleased]

## [2.7.0] - 2024-04-20
### Added
- Added the following new arguments:
  - `--rundeck.projects.nodes.info` - If passed, display Rundeck projects nodes info metrics, currently only the `rundeck_project_nodes_total` metric is available.
    - Requests for this check are cached as it can cause high CPU load depending on the number of projects.
  - `--threadpool_max_workers` - The maximum number of workers in the threadpool to run rundeck_exporter asynchronous checks.
    - Defaults to `(number of CPUs) + 4`, which may be too much on a server running other services.
  - `--rundeck.requests.timeout` - The maximum number of seconds that requests to the Rundeck API should timeout.
    - Defaults to 30.

### Changed
- Changed the functions `request_data_from` and `cached_request_data_from` to `request` and `cached_request`, respectively.
